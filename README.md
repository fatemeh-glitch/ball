## 🎲 Game Mechanics

### The Ball
- You're a cool red ball with a mind of its own
- Gravity pulls you down (that's just physics!)
- You can only jump when you're standing on a platform
- The higher you go, the more points you score!

### The Platforms
- Platforms appear randomly as you climb
- They're your only safe haven in this vertical world
- Each platform you pass gives you +1 point
- Miss a platform, and it's game over! 😱

### Scoring System
- Start with 0 points
- +1 point for each platform you successfully pass
- No points for falling (sorry, gravity doesn't give bonus points)

## 💡 Pro Tips
1. Timing is everything! Jump at the right moment
2. Don't rush - plan your jumps carefully
3. Use the walls to bounce back if you're going too fast
4. The higher you go, the more challenging it gets!
